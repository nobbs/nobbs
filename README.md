### Hello there 👋

My name is **Alexej Disterhoft**, but you can call me **Alex**. I am currently working as a **Kubernetes Platform Engineer** on the **Data Lake Team** at **DHL IT Services**. In addition, I am the **Tech Lead** for the Data Lake Kubernetes Platform.

_Although most of my work at DHL is not publicly available, I make an effort to contribute to open-source projects whenever possible._

I also maintain a blog where I occasionally write about the technical topics I have been working on. Check it out at [nobbs.dev](https://nobbs.dev) 🖥️

Furthermore, I am the devoted caretaker of three charming cats. Check out their Instagram [@mainzcoon](https://www.instagram.com/mainzcoon/) 🐈 🐈‍⬛ 🐈
